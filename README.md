![first run](images/First_Run.png)

As evident here that no proxy has been added. To use this extension, first, we need to add at least one proxy.

![empty dashboard](images/EmptyDashboard.png)

Click the Add New Proxy button to add a new row. In this row you can enter the following information about the proxy that you want to use: 
- Name - This is just a friendly name. 
- Proxy Protocol - Select HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS5. 
- Proxy IP - Enter IP address. You can also enter domains such as pr.oxylabs.io depending on your requirements.
- Proxy Port 
- Credentials - Leave blank for anonymous proxies: 
  - Username 
  - Password 
'If you are using Oxylabs proxies, enter pr.oxylabs.com as the proxy IP and 7777 as the port. You would also need to enter your username and password.'
Important: Do not forget to click Save Changes after entering the proxies. 
## Connecting to a Proxy 
Before changing the proxy, it will be a good idea to take note of the current IP address. The simplest way of finding your IP is to do a Google search with a phrase such as What is my IP. 
Your IP address will be listed before the search results. 
Connecting to a proxy is very easy. Click on the Oxylabs Proxy Manager icon. This will bring up the application window. 
In this window, you can see the message "No proxies connected" in red. Simply click the Connect button and you will be connected to a proxy.

'This screenprint shows the Oxylabs proxy server. However, you can use the Oxylabs Proxy Manager extension with any proxy.'
To verify that you are indeed connected to the correct server, do a Google search with the same phrase what is my ip. You will see that the IP would have changed.

## Adding Multiple Proxies 
Using Oxylabs Proxy Manager, you can add more than one proxy and switch between them easily. 
Click the Proxy Manager icon on the toolbar and then select Manage Proxies. You will be presented with the Manage Proxies screen. You can add as many proxies as needed. Here is sample with multiple proxies: 

![manage proxy](images/ManageProxy.png)

'If you are using Oxylabs proxy servers, you can add multiple country-specific proxy servers. For example, if you put us-pr.oxylabs.io under Proxy server IP and 10001 under Port, you will receive a US exit node with a sticky session. You can add another entry with proxy IP as fr-pr.oxylabs.io and port 40000. This will allow you to switch proxies between US and FR proxies.'
The next section will walk you through the process of using any of these proxies and switch to another as needed. 

## Switching Proxies 
This section will explain how to switch proxies. 
Once you enter multiple proxies in the Manage Proxies dashboard, you can switch proxies very easily. If you click the Oxylabs Proxy Manager icon, you will see all the proxies that you have entered.

You can repeat the steps with any other proxy and you will be able to change proxies easily. 

## Deleting Saved Proxy 
Deleting a saved proxy is as easy as adding a new proxy. Click the extension icon and select Manage proxies. On the Manage Proxies screen, you can delete any proxy by clicking the trashcan icon next to the proxy that you want to delete.
